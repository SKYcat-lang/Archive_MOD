 EGY_farouks_reforms_liberal_outlook: "Farouk's Reforms: Liberal Outlook"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_liberal_outlook_desc: "Farouk's reforms have taken a clearly reformist route; some have even called them, dare I say, liberal. One can only hope that they will lead to this 'New Egypt' the Young Sultan is dreaming of."
 EGY_farouks_reforms_conservative_outlook: "Farouk's Reforms: Conservative Outlook"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_conservative_outlook_desc: "'Why try to fix what is not broken?' Clearly this is the approach the Young Sultan has taken. His actions so far have mostly affirmed the status quo and codified it into law, padding it with moderate reforms here and there. Evidently, there are no big Surprises waiting for Egypt."
 EGY_farouks_reforms_absolutist_outlook: "Farouk's Reforms: Absolutist Outlook"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_absolutist_outlook_desc: "It has become increasingly clear that the Young Sultan has decided to take matters in his own hands, so to speak. Reform after Reform continues to consolidate more and more power onto his very own personhood."

 EGY_meet_with_the_greeks_decision: "Meet with the Greeks"
 EGY_meet_with_the_greeks_decision_desc: "The Greeks are the enemies of the Ottoman Empire and seek to take down the Turk. Meeting with them might prove fruitful and lead to them supporting our own ambitions against the Ottoman Empire."

 EGY_press_ottoman_surrender: "Press the [OTT.GetFlag] §YOttoman§! Surrender"
 EGY_press_ottoman_surrender_desc: "With allied control over all the key Arab cities and the Turks pushed back into the Anatolian mountains, we can finally say with pride that the Arab homeland has been liberated."

 EGY_egyptian_reforms_decisions: "Egyptian Reforms"
 EGY_egyptian_reforms_decisions_desc: "Sultan Farouk, though still a teenager, has a grand vision of a modern Egypt. This vision sees an Egypt that merges the greatness inherent in herself with the best parts of western ways of governing. To that end he is exerting the considerable authority given to the Sultan to embark on a programme of nation-building, extending and codifying the power of the Egyptian state over previously untouched aspects of life."

 EGY_improve_literacy: "Improve Literacy"
 EGY_improve_literacy_desc: "Egypt has crippling literacy and we must focus on improving literacy within the country."

 EGY_Integrate_Syria: "Integrate [From.GetName]"

 EGY_libyan_egyptian_unification_decisions: "Libyan-Egyptian Unification"
 EGY_libyan_egyptian_unification_decisions_desc: "With the dust settled in the Levant, Egyptian hawks have set their sight on the struggling nation of Tripolitania. Having only recently received its independence, the state is still struggling to decide its identity with concepts such as nationality new to most Libyans. This has opened up a window for expansion as the Bureau for Arab Affairs in Cairo has proposed to use subterfuge to bring the HIMT to power and through them annex Tripolitania into a greater Egyptian state."

 EGY_promote_the_HIMT: "Fund the HIMT"
 EGY_promote_the_HIMT_desc: "Named the Egypto-Tripolitanian Unification Party, this small offshoot of the wider Arab nationalist movement is the initiative of 'Ali Rajab who enlightened by the greatness of Egypt during his visit to Alexandria pursues the integration of Tripolitania into the greater Egyptian state, claiming that Tripolitania on its own has not the resources nor power to stand on its own."
 TRP_promote_the_HIMT: "Egypt Funds the HIMT"

 EGY_pan_arabist_propaganda: "Pan-Arabist Propaganda"
 EGY_pan_arabist_propaganda_desc: "Used to great effect in the lead-up to the War in the Desert, Radio Free Cairo and our network of Arab propagandists are working overtime to spread their message far and wide. Even in the tiniest village must Libyans be glued to their radio sets, listening to the great deeds of the Egyptian people and their immense martial prowess."
 TRP_pan_arabist_propaganda: "Egypt Promotes Pan-Arabism"

 EGY_decry_tripolitanian_nationalism: "Counter Tripolitanian Nationalism"
 EGY_decry_tripolitanian_nationalism_desc: "Although there has been a recent rise in Tripolitanian nationalism, exceeding the normal city and family ties that Libyans traditionally held sacred, it's still weak and through renewed efforts of our propaganda machine, can be replaced by a feeling of Arab statehood and with it a desire to become part of the Egyptian state."
 TRP_decry_tripolitanian_nationalism: "Egypt Counters Tripolitanian Nationalism"

 EGY_propose_unification: "Propose Unification"
 EGY_propose_unification_desc: "With our HIMT allies firmly in the saddle, the time has come to officially unite our two states. For the greater glory of Arabia, evidently..."

### Focus Tree - Economy ###
 EGY_modernization_program: "Modernisation Programme"
 EGY_modernization_program_desc: "The extremely weak nature of the Egyptian industrial economy requires our attention, through a programme of subsidies and state-sponsored businesses we can bring industrialisation to Egypt and become a truly modern country."
 EGY_egyptian_oil: "Egyptian Oil"
 EGY_egyptian_oil_desc: "Egypt has rich oil resources, if we could only exploit them. Foreign companies are keen to gain access to our reserves and will pay top dollar for them, by setting up joint ventures between them and the state we can save on the equipment required and ensure we get our cut."
 EGY_nile_dams: "Nile Dams"
 EGY_nile_dams_desc: "In 1903 the Nile was dammed by British engineer William Willcocks, now to support the electrification of Egypt we have several further damming projects planned along the White Nile that will provide power for thousands of homes and cities."
 EGY_industrialization: "Industrialisation Plan"
 EGY_industrialization_desc: "Egyptian industry requires substantial investment if it is to bloom, and to that end we have prepared a battery of policies intended to foster the growth of both heavy and light industries."
 EGY_civilian_improvements: "Civilian Improvements"
 EGY_civilian_improvements_desc: "Our policies have begun to pay off in the field of civilian manufacturing, with the manufacturing sector showing strong growth in our major urban centres."
 EGY_modernized_agriculture: "Modernised Agriculture"
 EGY_modernized_agriculture_desc: "The tractor is a wondrous invention that could revolutionise agriculture on the banks of the Nile. By supporting the mechanisation of farming we can not only vastly increase output but also increase migration to towns and cities, supporting industry."
 EGY_civilian_investments: "Civilian Investments"
 EGY_civilian_investments_desc: "While the private sector has been encouraged by our investments we must go further, and found some entirely state-owned enterprises to produce vital goods for our industry."
 EGY_red_see_trade: "Red Sea Ports"
 EGY_red_see_trade_desc: "Egypt's focus has long been the Mediterranean Sea, however there is a vast expanse to our south that could benefit from some infrastructure to support both military and trading vessels."
 EGY_railroad_expansion: "Railroad Expansion"
 EGY_railroad_expansion_desc: "Transportation is a vital part of our programme, and while previously our railroads had been purely built for the purposes of transporting goods to ports for export we intend to make the network much denser and provide for transportation between settlements for internal movement of goods and people."
 EGY_egyptian_airports: "Egyptian Airports"
 EGY_egyptian_airports_desc: "Aviation is more of a prestige project for us currently, showing Egypt to be the leading light of the Middle East in technical innovation. By constructing new airports with the help of European experts we can reinforce this notion and work towards a commercially viable aviation industry."
 EGY_military_improvements: "Military Investments"
 EGY_military_improvements_desc: "One of the easiest areas in which we can expand out industry is in arms production, over which we have a great deal of direct influence. Encouraging the domestic production of licensed German firearms will not only support the economy but arm the nation."
 EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria: "Dockyards of Alexandria"
 EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria_desc: "Alexandria was once the largest and most important port on the Mediterranean, while she may no longer claim this particular honour some expansion of her drydock and anchorage will let us accommodate the young Egyptian fleet more comfortably."
 EGY_cairo_institute_of_arms: "German Investment"
 EGY_cairo_institute_of_arms_desc: "Mauser and Walther, these names are a byword for quality armaments the world over. Now prestigious German firms are seeking to establish factories in Egypt and buy government arms contracts, we see no reason to prevent them."
 EGY_military_factories: "Electrification Programme"
 EGY_military_factories_desc: "Electricity in Egypt is entirely under the control of private companies, and as such there is very little standardisation of voltage and outlets. By introducing the Egyptian Electrical Authority we can bring electricity to rural areas as well as enforcing nation-wide standards."
 EGY_egyptian_cinema: "Hollywood On The Nile"
 EGY_egyptian_cinema_desc: "Our burgeoning middle class has shown a great appetite for the cinema and for the state it presents an untapped industry. Egypt is a sunny country with striking landscapes suitable for filming in, and as such large tax breaks should bring film companies flocking to our shores."
 EGY_egyptian_radio: "Egyptian Radio"
 EGY_egyptian_radio_desc: "Sultan Farouk's coronation speech was the first nationwide royal broadcast in Egyptian history, bringing the masses closer to their king than many of them could have dreamed. Now by investing in our communications infrastructure the whole nation may hear the Sultan's voice! The music is also popular."
 EGY_blue_nile_dams: "Blue Nile Dams"
 EGY_blue_nile_dams_desc: "Damming the White Nile was politically easy, given that over 90% of it lies within our realm. However the Blue Nile has presented a harder challenge, as much of it lies within the sometimes hostile nation of Ethiopia. We have resolved to press ahead with the project however and bring electrification to most of Sudan."
 EGY_synthetic_resources: "More Desert Oil"
 EGY_synthetic_resources_desc: "The success of our earlier oil ventures has given rise to a greater demand for exploitation than we have the resources to meet. By legalising and engaging in the sale of oil futures we can gain the capital to expand production extremely quickly."
 EGY_modernize_sudan: "Modernise Sudan"
 EGY_modernize_sudan_desc: "Thus far most of our efforts in modernisation have focussed on Egypt proper, and Sudan has benefited only marginally. By investing in the major urban centres at Khartoum, Omdurman and Jubba we can extend our reforms southward."
 EGY_expand_railroads: "Expand Railroads Southwards"
 EGY_expand_railroads_desc: "By expanding the rail network in Sudan and making it part of the wider Egyptian rail system we will not only improve the economy but ensure that Sudan is more strongly linked with Egypt proper than the rest of Africa."
 EGY_invest_in_sudan: "Invest in Sudan"
 EGY_invest_in_sudan_desc: "There are any number of rich people, Egyptian or otherwise, who wish to invest in our nation. Perhaps tax incentives could encourage them to take their money southwards, where it will breathe new life into the local economy."
 EGY_airports_for_sudan: "Airports for Sudan"
 EGY_airports_for_sudan_desc: "While the railway is a wonderful way to travel it just isn't fast enough for the breakneck pace at which business can move. By investing in air transport links with Khartoum we can ensure that businessmen resident in Cairo and Alexandria can look to their interests in the south at a moment's notice, as well provide air bases for the Royal Egyptian Air Force."
 EGY_resources_of_the_south: "Resources of the South"
 EGY_resources_of_the_south_desc: "We have it on good authority from a geological expedition by the University of Cairo that there are immense mineral deposits in Sudan just waiting to be tapped. Backing a new joint German-Egyptian Chromium concern will allow us to bring heavy industry to our southern reaches and diversify their economy immensely."
 EGY_new_universities: "New Universities"
 EGY_new_universities_desc: "It is not enough simply to rely on foreign experts to run our businesses. The creation of several new Austrian-style institutes of technology and research universities that will teach not just the liberal arts but physics, chemical engineering and nuclear science will greatly expand the knowledge base of our nation and provide skilled workers for modern industries."
 EGY_egyptian_steel: "Egyptian Steel"
 EGY_egyptian_steel_desc: "Commensurate with our new commitment to technical education comes a need to invest in a broader resource base. Rather than shipping ore abroad we intend to set up rolling mills in Port Said to produce Egyptian Steel for domestic use."
 EGY_new_economy: "New Economy"
 EGY_new_economy_desc: "In just a few short years Egypt's economy has begun to turn around, far from being a backwards agricultural nation she now enjoys a strong industrial base, institutions of higher education and a modern transport system. Whatever else may be, nobody can accuse the New Sultanate of being behind the times."

### Focus Tree - Politics ###
 EGY_black_monday_recovery: "Begin Black Monday Recovery"
 EGY_black_monday_recovery_desc: "While Black Monday has hit our relatively small manufacturing sector hard the biggest harm has been the fall in exports, particularly that of cotton. A vigorous programme of support for agriculture, the financial sector and industrial assets should begin as soon as possible."
 EGY_secure_cotton_fields: "Secure Cotton Fields"
 EGY_secure_cotton_fields_desc: "Cotton has a long history in Egypt, and is one of the crops most vital to our export economy. By taking unprofitable plantations into state ownership and consolidating them we can shore up the industry, as well as supporting our farmers and landowners."
 EGY_cotton_subsidies: "Cotton Subsidies"
 EGY_cotton_subsidies_desc: "The success of our purchase of cotton plantations has been apparent. Now that we have cushioned the impact of Black Monday on this sector we should institute a minimum price for cotton while simultaneously allowing estates to pass back into private hands, hopefully insuring us against another crash."
 EGY_secure_holdings: "Secure Holdings"
 EGY_secure_holdings_desc: "Not since the 1907 crash has the Egyptian stock market taken such a beating, the fallout from Black Monday is immense, but also opens up opportunities for us if we can manage matters correctly. For now we will close the Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges in order to carry out some emergency restructuring."
 EGY_protect_industry: "Protect the Industry"
 EGY_protect_industry_desc: "Protecting Egypt's small and fragile industrial base is a task best undertaken without too much foreign competition. With the introduction of tariffs and inducements to 'Buy Egyptian' we can show our support to our industrialists and aid them in weathering the economic storm."
 EGY_reopen_stock_exchange: "Re-open the Stock Exchange"
 EGY_reopen_stock_exchange_desc: "Allowing the Alexandria and Cairo Stock Exchange to remain closed any longer would be a mistake. The longer we keep one of Africa and the Middle East's most active stock markets closed the more we risk its position as a hub of trading. Reopening the market will show our confidence in the emergency reforms we have pushed through as well as allowing the recovery to begin."
 EGY_black_monday_over: "Black Monday is Over"
 EGY_black_monday_over_desc: "It seems that our programmes are beginning to pay off. While economies closer to the German sphere or embroiled in civil unrest continue sluggishly Egypt is already seeing a recovery in employment and economic growth."
 EGY_farouks_reforms: "Farouk's Reforms"
 EGY_farouks_reforms_desc: "Sultan Farouk, though still a teenager, has a grand vision of a modern Egypt. This vision sees an Egypt that merges the greatness inherent in herself with the best parts of western ways of governing. To that end he is exerting the considerable authority given to the Sultan to embark on a programme of nation-building, extending and codifying the power of the Egyptian state over previously untouched aspects of life."
 EGY_administrative_reforms: "Administrative Reforms"
 EGY_administrative_reforms_desc: "Currently in Egypt the state's power is based around notable locals, be they land owners or village headmen. This is an obvious area of priority for our young Sultan, who aims to standardise administration into four dozen governorates. The question now becomes who should be appointed to each one, and how?"
 EGY_judical_reforms: "Judicial Reforms"
 EGY_judical_reforms_desc: "Egypt's court system was innovative in 1875, however jurisprudence has moved on. Now, with collaboration of jurists from the University of Cairo, Sultan Farouk intends to overhaul the legal process. This affords the various factions in the Government to help influence exactly what that means."
 EGY_land_reform: "Land Reforms"
 EGY_land_reform_desc: "With the new governorate system proving effective the question of land reform has come up: we now have the authority to redistribute land and put it in the hands of peasants, who previously had rented it or even been enslaved. We could however formalise the status quo to win the support of the nobility, or use this chance to enhance the personal power of the Sultan instead."
 EGY_legal_reforms: "Legal Reforms"
 EGY_legal_reforms_desc: "Laying down the new Egyptian Civil Code is a huge task, and it would be a much better idea to base the system on a preexisting legal code. To that end various jurists are advising the Sultan on different codes of law, to see which one takes his fancy..."
 EGY_bureaucracy_reforms: "Bureaucracy Reforms"
 EGY_bureaucracy_reforms_desc: "Day-to-day bureaucracy is required to run a modern state with any kind of efficiency, to that end the hiring of officials must be overhauled to create a single system. Two camps are emerging pushing different ideas: one calls for meritocratic examinations to be given, the other for pedigree and tradition to be respected."
 EGY_parliament_reform: "Parliamentarian Reforms"
 EGY_parliament_reform_desc: "The question of the day is that of elections. While Egypt has adopted the German model of the royal diet being able to veto but not introduce legislation the question of liberalisation is being raised by those hoping to hope for a more British-style system. It will fall to the Sultan to support the status quo, liberalise or possibly even gut the diet all together!"
 EGY_islams_status: "The Status of Islam"

 EGY_education_reform_desc: "Education will lay the groundwork for the future of our new Egypt, but the topic of history is one liable to cause controversy if not handled properly. Ultimately the Sultan's word will carry great weight, and so it falls to him to decide if the focus of Egypt's history should be Pharaonic or if he should reject the pagan past in favour of our Islamic heritage."
 EGY_literacy_program: "Literacy Programme"
 EGY_literacy_program_desc: "Egypt's literacy rate is incredibly low, and for a modern nation and informed nation to emerge it must be rapidly increased.

 EGY_Coordinate_Al_Ahd_desc: "Similar to al-Fatat in intentions, Jamyat al-Ahd or the Covenant Society has most of its followers amongst the Arab officers of the Ottoman army. Due to the large presence of Iraqis amongst there, the organisation has (contrary to al-Fatat) primarily expanded its operations amongst the Iraqi vilayets and strives for the creation of an Iraqi state.

### Intro Screen ###
 EGY_country_intro_header: "The Sultanate of Egypt"
 EGY_country_intro_content: "The history of modern Egypt conventionally begins in 1882 when Egypt joined the British sphere of influence, a situation that conflicted with Egypt's de jure position as part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1914, the Protectorate was made official and the title of the head of state, which had changed from Pasha to Khedive in 1867, was again changed to Sultan. This formally repudiated the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, who was backing the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg. Abbas II was deposed by the British and replaced as Sultan by his uncle, Husayn Kamil. Upon his death in 1917, his only son, Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn, declined the succession, and Husayn Kamil's brother Ahmed Fuad ascended the throne as Fuad I.\n\nWith the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, Egypt remained part of a now weakened British sphere. This would increase anger within the Egyptian populace that exploded in violence in 1925 during the collapse of the British Empire. This would become known as the Egyptian Revolution where Fuad I proved his legitimacy by leading the people in the revolution. The Revolution was largely nationalistic in nature, uniting Egyptians of all social classes, faiths, and occupations together to rid Egypt of the British once and for all. In the chaos of the revolution, an international coalition (primarily led by Britain and Germany) seized the Suez Canal, which Egypt was forced to accept in order to avoid an open conflict with the former central powers.\n\nSince the revolution there has been a conflict between liberals that seek to go further and make the monarchy a true constitutional monarchy and conservatives that wish to keep the status quo. Moreover, as 1936 arrives, the Sultanate's eyes go increasingly upon the Young Farouk, the heir to the throne who is being groomed for the throne. With the decline of the Ottoman Empire, members of all political parties have begun to draft plans for a restoration of a mighty Egypt and dreaming of an Ottoman-free Middle East..."

After our rather forceful departure from the British sphere, much of the foreign capital within our nation has come from Germany and her economic sphere. Now, with the situation of those foreign investors becoming increasingly unclear, our largely export-based economy is starting to crack under the pressure. The agricultural sector, particularly the cotton sector, was hit rather hard. The people are begging their representatives within the Royal Diet as well as the Sultan to do anything they can to resolve the crisis."

 egy.4.a: "Egypt shall be brought into the modern age."

 egy.5.t: "[GetYear] General Election"
 egy.5.d: "Today is the long awaited election for the Prime Minister of Egypt. This year's election is particularly tense as it comes on the heels of the ascension of Farouk to the role of Sultan. The main four parties as before are running their candidates and the question is whom shall the people elect to be the prime minister?"
 egy.5.a: "The Liberal Constitutional Party."
 egy.5.b: "The Wafd Party."
 egy.5.c: "The Watani Party."
 egy.5.e: "The Ittihad Party."

 egy.6.e: "The Ittihad Party."

 egy.7.t: "Governorship Reform"
 egy.7.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the question of Governors has come up. The liberals believe that governors should be elected. While the conservatives believe that they should be nobles. However a third option has come up, appointed governors by the sultan himself selected through a meritocratic system."
 egy.7.a: "Elected Governors."
 egy.7.b: "Noble Governors."
 egy.7.c: "Appointed Governors."

 egy.8.t: "Judicial Reform"
 egy.8.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the question of the Judiciary has come up.

 egy.8.b: "Government Oversight."

 egy.9.t: "Bureaucracy Reform"
 egy.9.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the nature of the bureaucracy has been brought up. The liberals are pushing for a modern civil service system that is done on a meritocratic basis. While the conservatives believe that the civil servants should be appointed and heavily in favour of the nobility."
 egy.9.a: "Civil Service."
 egy.9.b: "Appointed Ministers."

 egy.10.t: "Land Reform"
 egy.10.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt, the topic of land reform has been brought up. The issue at hand is that less than six percent of Egypt's population owns more than 65% of the land of the country with less than 0.5% of Egyptians owning more than one third of all Fertile land. The liberals wish to combat this by redistributing the land to the people, principally through buying the land from the nobility. However, the conservatives despise such a notion and believe that such an action will only hurt Egypt's agricultural production. A third possibility has been brought up, and that would be to nationalise the land and have it all be the Sultan's land - at least on paper, anyways. The Sultan is already the largest landowner in Egypt, so this would not be impossible to implement."
 egy.10.a: "Redistribute the land."
 egy.10.b: "Formalise the status quo."
 egy.10.c: "All land shall be owned in name by the Sultan."

 egy.11.t: "Legal Reforms"
 egy.11.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the nature of the legal system has been brought up. The current legal system is an absolute mess with overlapping and conflicting areas of British, Ottoman, French and Egyptian Law all mixed together. Such a thing is not suitable for the new modern Egypt. To that end the laws must be reformed. However where one should look within the current laws for the main basis is a big question. The liberals believe that the British law within our legal system might be the best way to adopt, while conservatives believe that the French law is better. Finally some believe looking at the ideas of Muhammad Ali that he brought into the Egyptian system would yield the best system."
 egy.11.a: "British Law."
 egy.11.b: "French Law."
 egy.11.c: "Muhammad Ali's Law."

 egy.12.t: "Royal Dietarian Reform"
 egy.12.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the topic of Royal Dietarian Reform has been brought up. The Liberals believe that the Royal Diet should be strengthened at the cost of the power of the Monarchy. While the conservatives believe that the current status quo works fine as a balance between absolutism and liberalism. Finally a third option is to strengthen the monarchy while weakening the power of the Royal Diet."
 egy.12.a: "Strengthen the Royal Diet."
 egy.12.b: "Keep the Status Quo."
 egy.12.c: "Strengthen the Monarchy."

 egy.13.t: "Religious Reforms"
 egy.13.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the nature of religion has been brought up.

 egy.13.b: "Egypt is an Islamic Nation."

 egy.14.t: "Education Reforms"
 egy.14.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the topic of education has been brought up. The issue is what should be taught within schools.

 egy.14.a: "Pharaonist Identity."
 egy.14.b: "Islamic Identity."

 egy.15.t: "Tax Reforms"
 egy.15.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the topic of tax reform has been brought up. There are a few options: we can listen to the people and institute a land tax, which will fall primarily on the rich landowners, we can listen to our western advisors, who advise us to copy the progressive tax system of the European powers, or we can listen to the nobles and institute a flat tax."
 egy.15.a: "Land Tax."
 egy.15.b: "Flat Tax."
 egy.15.c: "Progressive Tax."

 egy.16.t: "Literacy Programme"
 egy.16.d: "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the topic of literacy has been brought up. The vast majority of Egypt's population is illiterate with nearly an 80% illiteracy rate, principally within the rural areas. To counter this a programme of educating the population is to begin. However, while most believe the focus should be on Egyptian Arabic, a few believe that we should focus on revitalising the Coptic Language."
 egy.16.a: "Focus on Programmes for Egyptian Arabic."
 egy.16.b: "Focus on revival of the Coptic language."

 egy.17.t: "The New Egypt"
 egy.17.d: "The reforms are finally done and with the reforms done, Egypt now moves into a new era, a modern era. The reforms may not have solved all of Egypt's problems but they have helped push her to a brighter future."
 egy.17.a: "Long live the Sultan! Long live Egypt!"

 egy.18.t: "Liberal Egypt"
 egy.18.d: "The reforms of the realm have brought about the liberal dreams that were born during the 1925 revolution. The reforms have transformed Egypt into a liberal constitutional monarchy with the sultan having a ceremonial role."
 egy.18.a: "Long live the Sultan! Long live Egypt!"

 egy.19.t: "Conservative Egypt"

 egy.19.a: "Long live the Sultan! Long live Egypt!"

 egy.20.t: "Absolutist Egypt"
 egy.20.d: "In a surprising move, Farouk the First has outmanoeuvred his courtiers and ministers and reasserted royal power within Egypt. The liberals are annoyed at the loss of liberty however, the power, majesty and glory of the Royal House has never been greater and throughout Egypt people are cheering the Sultan."
 egy.20.a: "Long live the Sultan! Long live Egypt!"

 egy.23.t: "German Investments in Egypt"

 egy.24.t: "Investment in Egypt"

 egy.27.a: "Let's see what these officers can do."

 egy.28.t: "Institute of Coptic Studies"
 egy.28.d: "With our policy of promoting the Coptic Language as a solution to solve the illiteracy issue, in Alexandria the institute of Coptic Studies was recently created. The Institute of Coptic Studies is dedicated to studying and promoting the Coptic Language. Such an institute is a great boon to our desire to promote the Coptic Language."
 egy.28.a: "Great."

 egy.29.t: "Women's Suffrage?"
 egy.29.d: "Since the Egyptian revolution of 1925 there has been a growing feminist movement within the realm. This has been supported by organisations like the Egyptian Feminist Union and in particular supported by middle to upper-class women. With the reform movement sweeping the country, many within the Egyptian Feminist Union are pushing to have female suffrage as part of the reforms. This of course has angered the Conservatives who believe that this will destroy the family."

 egy.29.b: "Do not support women's suffrage."

 egy.63.d: "The Ethiopian Empire is made up of many tribal ethnicities, not all of which are keen on being part of their empire.

 egy.63.a: "Let them feud among themselves."

 egy.64.t: "Tensions in the Empire"

 egy.65.t: "The Egyptian Plot Fails!"

Throughout his speech he made references to his father Muhammad Ahmad who began the Mahdist war, and in particular emphasised his role as the Mahdi.

 egy.100.t: "Questions of Egyptian Identity"
 egy.100.d: "When the Egyptian revolution of 1925 happened, questions of identity emerged: What does it mean to be Egyptian? When was Egypt great? It was the first time in centuries that the Egyptians were truly free and independent, so we were finally able to address these questions properly. Since then, two concepts of what it means to be Egyptian have formed, looking back on the past with romanticism, although they each look at radically different periods of Egyptian history.\n\nThe first camp is known as Pharaonism. They look to the pre-Islamic past, to the days of the Pharaohs, for a time when Egypt was truly great and powerful. They argue that Egypt is a Mediterranean civilisation and stress the role of the Mediterranean Sea within Egyptian culture, though they do not neglect the Nile. Largely it aligns with the Liberal parties - though strictly speaking it is not liberal, and even some of the Watani support it. It is by far the most influential form of identity of Egypt in 1936.\n\nThe second cultural movement is the Islamist movement, which arose as a counter to the more mainstream Pharaonism. They believe the period in which Egypt was most great was the era of Fatimid Caliphate and the Ayyubid dynasty. Instead of the Pharaohs, whom they decry as pagans and absolute tyrants, they look back to the time when Egypt was the centre of the Islamic world - when a multi-ethnic and tolerant Egypt was the dominant Islamic power. This cultural movement is more of a conservative counter to the more mainstream Pharaonism and is largely tied to the Conservative movements, particularly the Ittihad Party.\n\nIt should be noted that both camps support a multi-ethnic Egypt - both Pharaonists and Islamists believe that Egypt has always been a multi-ethnic state. Both concepts are largely romantic-nationalist in nature and have an impact upon culture and the arts."
 egy.100.a: "We are all Egyptians."

 egy.101.t: "Library Debate"
 egy.101.d: "As part of the modernisation programme, one of the things that have been brought up is that we should build a grand new library to celebrate the new Egypt.

 egy.101.a: "New Library of Alexandria."
 egy.101.b: "New House of Knowledge."

 egy.102.t: "Capital of Egypt"
 egy.102.d: "The question of the capital of Egypt has been brought up. The Pharaonists believe that to symbolise the new Egypt the capital should be relocated to Alexandria.

 egy.102.a: "Alexandria!"
 egy.102.b: "Cairo!"

 egy.103.t: "A New Lighthouse for Egypt"
 egy.103.d: "The Port Said Lighthouse has served as a beacon for the Suez Canal since 1869. Built by the Khedive Ismail, it has been appropriated by foreigners since the Canal opened. Now with the Canal in Egyptian hands, this old lighthouse could use a new coat of paint. The artists on hand have a bold idea to rename the lighthouse the "Pharos of Egypt" after the Pharos of Alexandria.

 egy.106.t: "New Grand Imam of the Al-Azhar University"

Today though a new Grand Imam must be chosen and the two leading contenders are naturally divided between the Pharaonist and Islamist camps. The Pharaonist candidate is Muhammad al-Zawahiri who has earned praise for his efforts to support the University as well as his reformist ideas. The Islamist candidate is Mustafa Hassan Abdul Razek who has earned praise for sparking a renaissance of Islamic philosophy within the University as well wanting to expand Islamic education throughout the realm. Whom shall be appointed as the next Grand Imam?"

The Aswan Lower Dam is finally complete, allowing Egypt unparalleled control over the Nile. The only question that remains is who to honour. Should we honour Ibn al-Haytham, who first envisioned the dam in the days of the caliphate? Should we name it after our honoured guest Adrian Daninos instead? It was he that made this possible."

 egy.107.b: "Ibn al-Haytham deserves to be honoured."

 egy.108.t: "Ministry of Awqaf"
 egy.108.d: "A bill has come before the Egyptian Diet regarding the Ministry of Awqaf, which oversees religious endowments and assigns imams to help run the Mosques.

 egy.108.a: "Let the Mosques run themselves."
 egy.108.b: "Let the government run the Mosques."

 egy.109.t: "Antara Is Released to Theatres"

The film's production in the hills above Cairo was disrupted by students from the Al-Azhar school. Despite this, the film has been released uncensored in major cities across Egypt.

 EGY_fuad_i_leader_desc: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 26th, 1868, in Giza Palace, Cairo, Khedivate of Egypt, Ottoman Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Fuad ascended to the Egyptian throne amidst the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and growing nationalism bolstered by continued British defeats in Europe. When the British Revolution broke out, Egypt revolted in turn. Fuad co-opted the revolution, presenting himself as an ardent nationalist, and promulgated a system of government modelled on that of Germany.\nFuad's subsequent social and economic reforms have raised questions in Egyptian society about the very identity of the Egyptian people and its place in a region still dominated by the hated Turk. Perhaps the seeds of progress sewn by Fuad will lead to glory. Perhaps his successors may succeed where other rulers have failed and lead Egypt to its rightful place as the shield and sword of an at last liberated Arab people."
